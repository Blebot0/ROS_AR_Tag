## ARTag 2 model usage

If you can't wait for me to change everything then go ahead and use ar_tag2.sdf and ar_tag2.config in the AR_Tag2 directory

Rename them as model.sdf and model.config ( standard ) and save the meshes directory with them in the ~/.gazebo/models directory

Also, you're supposed to put the .dae file and the marker2 .png in the meshes directory

Then you can just insert it into the gazebo world

PS: Just wait for me to change everything

PPS: Aditi's namespace problem solved
